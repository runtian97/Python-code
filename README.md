# Python-code

## Arithmetic operators:
addition: +
subsraction: -
multiplication: *
division: /
exponentiation: **     //2 ** 3 = 8
modulo: %              //find the remainder after dividing   9%2=1
integer division: // round down the division result (only reserve the integer part)   7//2=3  -7//2=-4

## reserved words in Python:
// False await else import pass None break except in raise True class finally is return and continue for lambda try as def from nonlocal while assert 
del global not with async elif if or yield 

## some examples given to show the assignment of value in Python (simplified mode):
#The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8

#The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

#decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall *= .9     // equal to rainfall = rainfall * 0.9

#add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume += rainfall

#increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
#into the reservoir in the days following the storm
reservoir_volume *= 1.05

#decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume *= 0.95

#subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
#that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5 

#print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)

## integer and floats
